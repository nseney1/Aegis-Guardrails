Given a natural language description of a concern, generate a governance rule in markdown with YAML frontmatter.

Rule types:
{type_lines}

YAML fields required:
- type: (one of above)
- domain: (one of: efficiency, correctness, security, style, governance)
- enforcement: (gate for invariants, advisory for traps)
- hypothesis: (clear, testable statement)
- prediction: (what will happen if the hypothesis is violated)
- falsification: (how to prove this rule is no longer needed)
- target_paths: (list of file glob patterns this rule monitors)
- minimum_mode: ({' | '.join(REVIEW_MODES)})
- tags: (list of relevant tags)

Do not write a fitness block: fitness is computed from the outcome ledger.

Existing rules in this project for reference:
{example_text}
{domain_context}{type_hint}

User description: "{description}"

Generate ONLY the complete markdown rule file content. Start with --- for the YAML frontmatter. After the closing ---, include a brief description paragraph explaining the rule's purpose. Do not include any other text."""
